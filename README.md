## Features

- **AI Website Generation:**
  - Generates complete, professional websites from your prompt using Gemini AI (Google Generative Language API).
  - Supports both plain HTML/CSS/JS and React+Tailwind project structures.

  - Produces interactive, feature-rich, and responsive designs with advanced UI/UX patterns.

- **Modern Frontend UI:**
  - Clean, two-column layout with sidebar, code editor, live preview, and logs.
  - Device preview toggles, grouped action buttons, and a fun animated loading overlay.
  - Beautiful typography (Inter, Fira Code) and indigo accent color.

- **Robust Backend:**
  - FastAPI server with CORS support and static file serving.
  - No artificial delays—waits only for AI to finish.
  - Detailed prompts to maximize website quality and relevance.
  - Returns detailed error messages for easier debugging.

- **Developer Friendly:**
  - Easy to run locally or deploy to the cloud.
  - Modular codebase for easy extension and customization.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- Gemini API key (Google Generative Language API)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Aditya-padale/AI-Website-Builder-Agent.git
   cd AI-Website-Builder-Agent
   ```

2. **Install backend dependencies:**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up your Gemini API key:**
   - Export your API key as an environment variable:
     ```sh
     export GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key
     ```
   - Or add it to a `.env` file if supported.

4. **Run the backend server:**
   ```sh
   uvicorn backend.main:app --reload
   ```
   The server will start at `http://localhost:8000`.

5. **Access the frontend:**
   - Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8000`.

## Troubleshooting

- **Gemini API Quota Exceeded:**
  - If you see a `429` error or quota message, you have exceeded your daily free tier. Wait for reset or upgrade your plan.
- **Broken Images:**
  - The AI is instructed to use only Unsplash/Pexels direct links. If you see broken images, try regenerating or refining your prompt.
- **React Generation Errors:**
  - Check the logs panel for detailed error messages from the backend.
